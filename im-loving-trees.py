# Treeeeeeees! A special, dear type of graph
# Duh duh duh duh duuuuuh, I'm lovin' dat graph theory

# root node: 0+ child nodes
# child: 0+ child nodes
# no cycles
# leaf: no children

# Make sure to clarify tree/graph questions! 

# TREES
	# BINARY TREES: up to two children per parent node
		# BINARY SEARCH TREES--ordering property: all left descendants <= node < all right descendants
			# point of clarification: duplicate values? which side of node?
		# COMPLETE BINARY TREES: fully filled, filled left to right
		# FULL BINARY TREES: nodes have either 0 or 2 children
		# PERFECT BINARY TREES: FULL and COMPLETE with 2^k - 1 nodes, k = # levels
			# leaves: same level--max # nodes

	# BALANCED: insertion and find: O(log n)
		# PERFECT BINARY TREES
		# RED-BLACK TREES
		# AVL TREES

	# UNBALANCED
